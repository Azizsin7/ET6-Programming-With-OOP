# Test-Driven Development

> To refresh TDD, review the Foundations materials in [Programming with Python](https://github.com/MIT-Emerging-Talent/ET6-Programming-With-Python) and the class recording.

Practice developing classes with discipline using Test Driven Development. The exercises give you a short bullet point description of a class, you write the tests, documentation and class. Good luck!
