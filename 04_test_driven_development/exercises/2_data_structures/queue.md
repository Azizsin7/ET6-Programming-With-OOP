# Queue

Write a class called `Queue`. It should behave like a typical first-in-first-out (FIFO) structure.

## Required behaviors

- `enqueue(item)`: Add to the back.
- `dequeue()`: Remove and return the front item, or `None` if empty.
- `peek()`: See the front item without removing it.
- `is_empty()`: Return `True` if empty.

## Later spec

- Add a `get_length()` method that shows the number of items.
- Add a `reverse()` method that reverses the queue in place.
