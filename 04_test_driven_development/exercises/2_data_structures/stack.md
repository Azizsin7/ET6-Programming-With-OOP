# Stack

Write a class called `Stack`. It should behave like a typical last-in-first-out (LIFO) structure.

## Required behaviors

- `push(item)`: Add an item to the top.
- `pop()`: Remove and return the top item, or `None` if empty.
- `peek()`: Return the top item without removing it.
- `is_empty()`: Return `True` if empty.

## Later spec

- Add a `get_size()` method that returns how many items are on the stack.
- Add a `clear()` method that empties the stack.
