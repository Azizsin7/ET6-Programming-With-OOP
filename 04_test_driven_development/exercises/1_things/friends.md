# Friends

Write a class called `Friends`.

- It should start with an empty list.
- You can call `add_friend(friend_name)` to add a friend to your list (you decide what happens if the friend already exists).
- You can `lose_friend(friend_name)` to remove it if it exists (you decide what happens if the friend doesn't exist).
- You can `has_friend(friend_name)` which returns True if the friend is present, False otherwise.
- You can `name_friends()` which returns all friends' names in a well-formatted string.
- ... your turn!  invent 2+ more methods for the `Friends` class
