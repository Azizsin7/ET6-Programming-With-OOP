# Game Character

Write a class called `GameCharacter`.

- A character has a name and starting health (default 100).
- You can `take_damage(amount)`, which subtracts from health.
- You can `heal(amount)`, which adds to health but not above 100.
- You can `is_alive()` which returns True if health > 0, False otherwise.
- You can `get_status()` which returns a string like "Alice: 78 HP".
- ... your turn!  Invent 2+ methods of your own.
