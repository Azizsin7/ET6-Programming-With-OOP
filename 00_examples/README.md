# OOP Examples

Many of the exercises in this repository explore different ways to study OOP examples.  Below are some suggestions for where to find examples at your level, focusing on the language features you want to study.

## Generating Examples with LLMs

You can also generate examples for your self-study using an LLM.  Below is a starter-prompt you can adjust to guide the LLM towards generating helpful examples:

```md
> learning goal: deeply understand a specific feature of classes/instances in Python by stepping through focused examples in a debugger

Can you generate ~5 small example programs illustrating how {insert language feature} works?   Then generate ~5 small code completion exercises that use this language feature in a similar way. The exercises should focus on my _understanding of program execution_, not on my ability to _apply_ these language features in practice.

Here is my best understanding of how this language works, please create examples that will help me reinforce and expand this understanding: __

---

Inspiration for the LLM:

- All programs should be as short as possible without loosing important detail.
- Fit examples and exercises in the _zone of proximal development_.
- Include comprehension questions as comments.
- Exercises can use `assert`s to quiz me about _program state_ at different points of execution
- Exercises can use blanks (_) to indicate where a piece of syntax is missing.
```
