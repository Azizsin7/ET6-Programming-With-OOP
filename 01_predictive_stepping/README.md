# Predictive Stepping with Classes

Before moving on to the next chapters in this repository that talk about how to _use_ classes in a program, take some time to understand how they work in Python. The best way to understand how classes and instances work in Python is with [_Predictive Stepping_](https://github.com/MIT-Emerging-Talent/ET6-Programming-With-Python/tree/main/2_predictive_stepping).  

You should start over with _predictive stepping_ each time you explore a new OOP language feature.

## Class vs. Instance

Understanding the difference between a _class declaration_ and a _class instance_ is fundamental, without this you will never understand OOP.  So we've included [a few starter examples](./exercises/class_vs_instance/) to study.
